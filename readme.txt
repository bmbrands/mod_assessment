Mod assessment

This is the Assessment plugin for Moodle.

About this plugin.
The Assessment plugin allows teachers to quickly grade users based on an award system. Each award is associated with a grade and added to the Moodle gradebook when clicked.

The assessment plugin supports:
  Groups / Grouping
  Adding Feedback
  Quick Feedback editing

Setting up the Assessment
When creating a new Assessment, you can configure the Name, Intro text and Awards. A new instance can be configured with 3 awards. If more awards are needed the number of awards can be configured using the "Number of Award options" option. After changing the number of awards click "Save and return" and configure the new award

Each Award should be given a name, image and grade. 
The recommended settings are:
  Short award names (gold, silver, bronze)
  Award images of approximately 100px by 100px
  Award grades ranging from 0 to 100

There are no limits to the number of awards configured in an assessment. The Grading interface looks best with 2 to 5 awards.

When the setting "Allow HTML editor for feedback" is set to yes in the Edit Assessment Form Teachers can click on the username or edit icon in the user listing to add feedback. This opens a new page with the user, awards and a HTML editor.
If the setting "Allow HTML editor for feedback" is set to no, a teacher can use quick feedback editing using JavaScript.

Assessing Students
When the Assessment is fully configured teachers, editing teachers and managers can start grading students. The users shown in the list are limited to the group users when separate groups are configured. If the teacher can access multiple groups, a group select option is visible.

The maximum number of students shown on the Assessment interface is 20. If there are more users to assess pagination is added at the end of the list of users.
